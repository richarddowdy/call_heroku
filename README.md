Setup - 

* Clone the repo locally.
* 'cd' into the repo
* create a python virtual environment with `python3 -m venv venv`
* start your venv with `source venv/bin/activate`
* install all the required packages with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Once the project has been setup, make sure to go inside the wake_heroku.py file change the 
URL and variable to match your Heroku project. Once these have been reassigned, the script 
can be run by typing the command `python3 wake_heroku.py` in the terminal from inside your
cloned repo directory.
